## Description
TLK is an interface that enables Python applications to execute bash scripts in the Linux operating system. This tool is particularly useful for automating system administration tasks on the server.

The main goal of TLK is to reduce coupling or dependency between Python applications and the operating system when executing bash scripts. By separating specific system tasks into bash scripts, Python applications can interact with the operating system in a more modular and secure manner, increasing the flexibility and stability of the software.

Bash scripts are an effective way to automate system administration tasks in Linux, and TLK provides the possibility of communication between projects written in Python and the Linux operating system through the execution of functions that run operating system tasks written in bash code. In summary, TLK is a practical solution for integrating Python applications and bash scripts in Linux systems, improving the efficiency and scalability of software on the server.
